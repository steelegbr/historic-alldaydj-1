# AllDay DJ

The original AllDay DJ playout system or the project for my Advanced Higher Computing qualification as it's better known. Written in VB6, this system can play rudimentary playlists and even boasts mutli-soundcard support!

The original code was written in 2005 and shouldn't really be used for anything other than historic interest in 2022.

<table align = "center" border = "5">
<tr valign = "top"><th>Use AllDay DJ On A Dedicated Machine</th><td>Machines used for other tasks such as internet browsing will over time reduce the resourses available to AllDay DJ.</td></tr>
<tr valign = "top"><th>Use A Screensaver</th><td>Admittedly this uses RAM but it is worthwhile compared to the cost of a new monitor due do screen burn.</td></tr>
<tr valign = "top"><th>Use A High Performance A Mahine If Possible</th><td>Simplified, AllDay DJ is playing several sound files at once. The more resourses available, the better.</td></tr>
<tr valign = "top"><th>Backup Your Data</th><td>If you network your AllDay DJ Machine(s), you can have central music storage on another machine and update the database for all your machines simultaniously. This allows you to make backups of the data. The files you need to backup are <i>logs.mdb, record_collection.mdb, news.dat, station.dat, rotation.dat </i>&amp;<i> soundcard.dat</i> These store your settings and music database.</td></tr>

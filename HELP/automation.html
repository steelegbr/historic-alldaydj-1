<!-- Main Content -->

<p>Selecting the <u>A</u>utomate button (see <a href = "controls.html">Controls</a>) will put the system into automatic rotation.</p>
<p>This means that the system will continually select items at random from the database and add them to the playlist when it becomes empty.</p>
<p>You can still add to and edit the playlist and all other controls work as normal in automatic rotation.</p>
<p>To quit automatic rotation, select the <u>S</u>top button. As this stops the players in their current state, it is suggested you select <i>Break After</i> then <u>S</U>top</p>
